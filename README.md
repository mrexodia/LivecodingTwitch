# LivecodingTwitch

Bot to synchronize [Livecoding](https://livecoding.tv) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) stream chats. This application is designed for streamers who want to stream on both services, but only use one of the chat clients. It is recommended to create separate accounts that run the chatbot.

2. Open and compile `Src/libcommuni/libcommuni.pro` with Qt creator in a directory (for example `build-x64-debug`);
